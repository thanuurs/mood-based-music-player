## Audio Generation Details

The app uses the Web Audio API to generate music dynamically:

### Musical Patterns by Mood

- **Happy**: A4 (440Hz) major chord progression with sine waves at 120 BPM
- **Sad**: A3 (220Hz) minor progression with sine waves at 60 BPM  
- **Energetic**: E4 (330Hz) power chord with sawtooth waves at 140 BPM
- **Calm**: G3 (196Hz) peaceful progression with sine waves at 80 BPM
- **Romantic**: C4 (261Hz) romantic progression with triangle waves at 90 BPM
- **Angry**: D3 (146Hz) aggressive progression with square waves at 160 BPM

### Rhythmic Patterns

Each mood has unique rhythmic envelopes that create different feels:
- Strong-weak patterns for happy moods
- Flowing patterns for romantic moods
- Driving patterns for energetic moods
- Gentle patterns for calm moods

## Customization

### Adding New Moods

1. Add the new mood to the `MoodType` in `client/src/types/spotify.ts`
2. Update the mood configurations in `client/src/components/mood-selector.tsx`
3. Add audio patterns in `client/src/lib/audio-generator.ts`
4. Update the cactus animations in `client/src/components/dancing-cactus.tsx`

### Modifying Audio Patterns

Edit the `getMoodFrequencies` method in `client/src/lib/audio-generator.ts` to:
- Change frequencies (musical notes)
- Adjust wave types (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
- Modify tempo (BPM)

### Styling Changes

The app uses Tailwind CSS with custom mood gradients defined in `client/src/index.css`:
- `.mood-gradient-happy`: Yellow to orange to pink
- `.mood-gradient-sad`: Blue to purple gradients
- `.mood-gradient-energetic`: Red to orange to yellow
- And more...

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support with Web Audio API
- **Firefox**: Full support with Web Audio API
- **Safari**: Full support with Web Audio API
- **Mobile browsers**: Supported (may require user interaction to start audio)

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build locally

### Environment Setup

No environment variables or external API keys required! The app works completely standalone.

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Playing

1. **Check browser permissions**: Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio
2. **Try clicking a mood button**: This provides the required user interaction
3. **Check browser console**: Look for any audio context errors

### Cactus Not Animating

1. **Check that a mood is selected**: The cactus only animates when music is playing
2. **Ensure Framer Motion is working**: The animations rely on the Framer Motion library

### Development Issues

1. **Clear npm cache**: `npm cache clean --force`
2. **Delete node_modules and reinstall**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. **Check Node.js version**: Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher
