*Project Title: “MoodTunes Cactus” – A Cartoonish Mood-to-Music Recommender App*  

### 🔥 Project Concept
An interactive web app that detects or lets the user select a mood (e.g. Happy, Sad, Angry, Chill) and instantly plays a curated Spotify playlist. The centerpiece is a *dancing animated cactus* that changes facial expressions and dance moves based on the selected mood.

### 🧠 Core Features

#### 🎧 Mood Detection & Selection
- *Option 1:* Let users type a short journal-style sentence (ML-based emotion detection via Hugging Face API).
- *Option 2:* Let users choose from pre-set moods (Happy, Sad, Energetic, Calm, Romantic, Angry).

#### 🌈 Spotify Integration
- Authenticate via *Spotify Web Playback SDK* + OAuth.
- Fetch playlists using *Spotify’s “recommendations” API* filtered by mood-based seed parameters (energy, valence, tempo).
- Autoplay tracks on mood selection.

#### 🌵 Dynamic Cartoon UI (with Canvas or Lottie)
- Use *Lottie animations* or CSS/JS canvas to show a *cartoon cactus*:
  - Happy: Wide smile, disco dance
  - Sad: Droopy arms, slow swaying
  - Angry: Fire aura and stomping feet
  - Chill: Sway with sunglasses
- Background color and music visualization synced to the song’s tempo and energy.

#### 🎛 Bonus UX Features
- Progress bar shows how long a mood “vibe” session lasts.
- Mood history timeline.
- Easter egg dances for special moods like “In love” or “Exam stress.”
